# Overview

There is currently only one type of API (as far as I know):
* Programming API: A user-created modding API that can be integrated into your C# Content Warning mod.

There may be multiple APIs for a single concept, each with their own pros and cons.

APIs marked with a ``Gold Star ⭐`` have a tutorial on this wiki.

If not, most will have documentation linked on their page.

## Programming APIs
### Configuration
* [ConfigSync](https://thunderstore.io/c/content-warning/p/Notest/ConfigSync/) is a tool for developers to temporarily sync host configs with other players in a lobby.
* [ContentSettings](https://thunderstore.io/c/content-warning/p/CommanderCat101/ContentSettings/) is a library that allows developers to add custom settings to the game.

### Content
* [ContentLibrary](https://thunderstore.io/c/content-warning/p/Notest/ContentLibrary/) is a library that handles ID assignment, creation and replication of ContentProviders and ContentEvents for things like custom comments on your videos.

### Sounds
* [MoreSounds](https://thunderstore.io/c/content-warning/p/ViViKo/MoreSounds/) adds the ability to add more sounds to the SoundPlayer.

### Items, Monsters, Maps, etc.
* ⭐ ContentLib is a modding API that allows developers to add custom monsters, items, maps, and more to the game. Coming soon.

### Networking
* [MyceliumNetworking](https://thunderstore.io/c/content-warning/p/RugbugRedfern/MyceliumNetworking/) is an easy-to-use networking library for sending custom RPCs through Steam.

Documentation for more APIs may be added to the wiki at a later date.

## Getting Your API On The Wiki
If you're an API developer and want to get your API added to this list, please contact me on Discord (``novinity``), assuming your API meets the following criteria:
* Open Source
* Fairly well documented - even better if you write a wiki article

1: Some exceptions may be made if it's an especially groundbreaking API, or it's the only existing solution.
