# Using the Project

Each project has it's pros and cons. The template project allows for quicker opening on the first run and a smaller project file. This comes with the downside of there being no logic included in any of the code, and most of the assets have been stripped. This is fine if you know what you're doing.

The AssetRipper option, however, will allow for you to view all the decompiled code of the game and have access to all it's assets, prefabs, etc. with the downside of taking longer to open on first run. This is useful if you want to understand how something works or what components to put on what object.

For this example, the AssetRipper project will be used.
